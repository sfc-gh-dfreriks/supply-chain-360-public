# SAP BDC Supply Chain 360 — Public (anonymous) build

A static, no-login public build of the SAP BDC Supply Chain 360 dashboard, deployed to
GitHub Pages. Dashboards render from a **point-in-time data snapshot** (no Snowflake
connection, no credentials in the browser). The optional "Ask the Agent" page calls a
separate serverless Cortex agent when configured.

## How it works

- **Dashboards:** built with `VITE_STATIC=1`. The client reads pre-baked JSON in
  `public/data/*.json` (keyed by plant-filter combination) instead of a live `/api`.
- **Data refresh:** re-run the exporter against the live dashboard server, commit the
  updated `public/data/*.json`, and push — Actions redeploys.
  ```bash
  # from the supply_chain_dashboard_react monorepo, with the server running:
  EXPORT_BASE=http://localhost:3001 node scripts/export-static.mjs
  ```
- **Live agent (optional):** set the repo variable `AGENT_URL` to a deployed Cortex
  agent Worker URL. The build injects it as `VITE_AGENT_URL`; the Analyst page then
  POSTs to `<AGENT_URL>/analyst`. If unset, the Analyst page shows a "not available"
  notice but the dashboards work fully.

- **Operations pages:** Order Fulfillment, Equipment Health and Components are
  snapshotted like the rest. Their data is the OPS_EXT demo enrichment —
  representative, not customer data.
- **Ask Cortex:** the default answer for every topic (plus each plant's
  constraint, the listed late orders and the first serial) is baked into
  `public/data/ask_cortex.json` by the exporter. Free-text questions go to
  `<AGENT_URL>/ask-cortex` when `AGENT_URL` is set, otherwise the panel says the
  live app is needed.

## Local build

```bash
npm ci
VITE_STATIC=1 npx vite build      # outputs dist/
python3 -m http.server -d dist    # preview
```

## Deploy

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with
`BASE_PATH=/supply-chain-360-public/` and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

No secrets are stored in this repo. It contains only synthetic SAP demo data.
